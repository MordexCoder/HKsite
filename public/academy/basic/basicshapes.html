        Being able to start your drawing with simple forms helps you know the structure of the drawing, like the proportion, the composition, and even how the anatomy will look like. This helps for when you notice mistakes, so you can change things without having put time into the piece yet. Using a cube, ball, and cylinder, will force you to forget the small details, and help you focus on the bigger picture.<br><br>

        By changing, adding, or subtracting the basic shapes, you get more complex versions, that help you build the foundation for something like a car, or a dick. Any part of the body can be essentially blocked down to it's most basic form. Don't be afraid to draw the shapes or the construction lines , even if you think it might make your drawing "look unprofessional". The best thing to do early on is to be familiar with the basic principles, and draw as many construction lines or shapes as you can, so that later on, they're engraved in your mind so you see them on the drawing without actually drawing them.<br><br>

        Shapes help build perspective, since the nature of the cube demands it. Of course we won’t talk too much about perspective in this section, but it’s good to at least acknoweledge it, and keep it in mind while drawing.<br><br>

        (drawing of the human body divided in cubes and cuboids)<br><br>

        As you can see, we’ve made each part of the body separated in very basic forms, enough that we can get a feel for the mass of the drawing. Having them this blocked, we can easily change the pose without shedding a tear at the time lost. They’re not accurate to their real life counterpart, but they’ll be good for now. <br><br>
