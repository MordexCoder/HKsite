        Learning how to study seems pretty stupid, I know. I’ll show ways of studying effectively, so that you’ll learn, and not die of boredom whilst doing it. This has to come before anything, because knowing this before going into the rest will help you digest this guide and other tutotials properly.<br><br>
        Now, there are different ways of studying, including: Text or books, video guides and tutorials, or simply using reference images to study something yourself. All these methods are valid, and what I’ll be teaching is how to study using those methods.<br><br>
       I’m someone who doesn’t particularly like studying, and on top of that, i get distracted very easily. Since i can’t focus on studying for more than 30 minutes, the way i personally go about it, is 25 minute study sessions, and take a break of 5-10 minutes. Whilst in the break, i try not to watch any videos, so i don’t take in more information than necessary.<br><br>
       If you’re reading a book on anatomy, like Bridgeman, it’s ok if you don’t understand everything the first time around, the fact that you now know that this tip or term exists will help you later on.<br><br>
       Let’s say for example you’re studying anatomy, you go over a few books, learn a lot of muscle groups you didn’t know existed, however you can’t draw them all perfectly, or even decently. That’s totally fine. Now that you know about the existence of those muscle groups, you’ll be conscious of them when you draw a person the next time. Then, the more you study and go over the same lessons from different sources, angles and points of view, you’ll start to get a firmer grasp on what it is that you’re actually drawing.<br><br>
       A good advice for when you’re studying, for whatever it might be, is that you should be absolutely focused. This means no distractions, especially music. Listening to music doesn’t make it so you’re giving all your atention to the study. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhG7DENh-uk">Here's a video that better explains what I’m trying to say.</a><br><br>
       So, to sum it up, study for around 25min with 5-10min breaks, always go back and revise what you already learned, and <b>do not listen to music when studying</b><br><br>
