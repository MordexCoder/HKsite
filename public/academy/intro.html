    <p>
      Welcome to the ongoing project of the Horny Kine Academy.<br></p><p> I'm Mordex, a hentai artist, I specialize in semi realistic art as of now, with the
      occasional line art work. I am, by no means a successful artist yet, I still have quite a lot to learn.
      Fortunately I also have a lot to teach as well, and by sharing I will also learn new tricks and techniques I
      otherwise wouldn't have. Everything I know about art will be cultivated and made into a project, one I haven't seen
      done, decently, at least. Please feel free to share this with any fellow NFSW artist.<br>
      This Academy will be an ongoing project: I will still implement lessons or teachings even after finishing the
      basic, intermediate, and advanced guides. Hopefully in the future this culminates into a well developed and
      friendly community.<br><br></p>


      <p>First off, <b>you will not get good from this.</b> This is a guide, not a miracle. This guide gets you barely half of the way,
      everything else depends on how much you practice.<br> Drawing well isn’t talent, talent is the patience to keep practicing even without seeing immediate results. Accepting your faults and taking criticism gracefully, is talent. Now get your ass off of youtube and let's continue.<br><br>

      This is a guide meant for those without money or resources, I have no intent of making this guide a paid one, and
      also do not condone nor allow others to profit out of this guide by putting it behind a paywall.<br><br></p>

      <p>I’ve seen people say drawing everday isn’t necessary, and that’s true, it isn’t necessary. But if you want to have
      a chance to get a job making art, then every day you don’t draw is a day farther away from your goals. If your
      mentality isn’t to at least try to draw everyday, then you’ve already fallen behind. Right now, in your place,
      getting a commission, or being hired by a big company is someone who knew they didn’t have a choice but to
      dedicate themselves in order to acheive their dream. They didn’t want to live their lives doing something they
      didn’t enjoy, so they spent every other day paving their own road to their goals, and yes, they drew every day.
      It’s not a necessity to draw every day, but you should.<br><br></p>

      <p> I will teach here is from my experience, but I will also implement teachings from other artists that tackle
      concepts I wouldn't normally draw. The goal is to help you have a basic understanding of how to draw your
      fetishes, commissions and illustrations, from furrys to "petite". I will begin from the basics which won't seem
      quite hentai related, but it'll help set the groundwork for future concepts and lessons. If you are a beginner, I
      heavily encourage you to practice these beginner lessons, to prevent you from having to go back to learn it
      properly. That being said, I'll try to make every lesson as hentai themed as possible.
      This guide will cover illustration first, then as it progresses, we will go over other hentai related topics, such
      as panelling your doujin.
      I will every now and then, post a link to a video or channel that goes over the general topic of what we discuss.
      There are channels who have much more experience when it comes to drawing, that would most likely explain in more
      detail what we go over here. I highly encourage to watch not only them, but other artists as well.<br><br>
